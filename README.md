# Udacity_Project_2_Investigate-The-Movie-Database

This is my repository for the project and files for the second project in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program.

## Description

The goal of this project is to choose a dataset from the available choices and then go through the data analysis process. This project utilized the following Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib. Finally, everything came together for conclusions. The specific dataset I use in this project is "The Movie Database (TMDb)". I analyze the data to answer the several research questions, such as which month/year/movie genres have the highest release of movies and earns the most profits, which movies have the highest revenue/profit/popularity/average count and what kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues, and many more.
